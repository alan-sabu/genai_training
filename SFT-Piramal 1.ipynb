    "Despite the benefits of user-generated content, managing its quality poses significant challenges. The primary issues faced by these platforms include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Volume and Diversity of Content**: With thousands of queries posted daily, manually monitoring and evaluating each query's quality is impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Varying Quality Standards:** User contributions vary widely in quality, with some queries being clear and detailed, while others are ambiguous, off-topic, or inappropriate.\n",
    "2. **Resource-Intensive Moderation:** Moderating content to ensure quality is resource-intensive, requiring significant human effort to edit low-quality queries or close inappropriate ones.\n",
    "3. **User Experience:** Inconsistent quality of content can lead to a poor user experience, reducing engagement and the likelihood of users returning to the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address these challenges, there is a need for an automated solution that can efficiently classify user queries into high quality, low quality (edited one or more times), and low quality (closed). By leveraging Generative AI techniques, specifically fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), we aim to develop a system that can:\n",

    "Automatically assess the quality of user queries.\n",
    "Reduce the manual effort required for content moderation.\n",
    "Enhance the overall user experience by ensuring high-quality content is prominently featured and low-quality content is appropriately managed.\n",
    "This case study focuses on implementing and fine-tuning an LLM to achieve these objectives, providing a scalable and efficient solution for maintaining high content standards in open question-answer forums."
